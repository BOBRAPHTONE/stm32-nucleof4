# STM32Nucleo-F4 Ethernet Shield example
This example project shows how to use the official Arduino Ethernet shield with a STM32 Nucleo-F401RE board. For more information about the code, you can read the full story on [my blog](http://www.carminenoviello.com/en/).

**The example is preconfigured to work with Nucleo-F401RE and Nucleo-F411RE boards.**
