# STM32Nucleo-F4 BlueNRG example
This example project shows how to use the X-NUCLEO-IDB04A1 shield, based on the BlueNRG network processor, in conjuction with a Nucleo-F4 board. It was generated in Eclipse using [GNU ARM Eclipse](http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/blog/) by Liviu Ionescu. If you need to setup the whole Eclipse/GCC ARM tool-chain, you can follow [this series](http://www.carminenoviello.com/en/2014/12/28/setting-gcceclipse-toolchain-stm32nucleo-part-1/) made of three parts on my blog.

I wrote a more detailed tutorial available on [my blog](http://www.carminenoviello.com/en/2015/03/08/bluenrg-shield-stm32-nucleo/).

**The example is preconfigured to work with Nucleo-F401RE and Nucleo-F411RE boards.**
